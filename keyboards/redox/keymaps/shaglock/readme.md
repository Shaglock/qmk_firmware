# A tweaked keymap for Redox

This keymap modifies the [default keymap](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/redox) for the awesome [Redox keyboard](https://github.com/mattdibi/redox-keyboard) designed by Mattia Dal Ben.

Used Baltazore's layout as a target.

## Changes to the default keymap

Keymap changes from the default keymap are:

- Change default `ESC` into `ESC` on tap, `CTRL` on hold - Love the UNIX-ey `CTRL` key location and wanted to keep `ESC` in the original position
# TODO: delay?
# TODO: remove page up/down home end
# TODO: add delete
